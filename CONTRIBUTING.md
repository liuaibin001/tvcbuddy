# Contributing to CC Mate

Thank you for your interest in contributing to CC Mate! This guide will help you get started with development, building, and contributing to the project.

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** 18+ with **pnpm** (required package manager)
- **Rust** 1.70+ and **Cargo**
- **Tauri CLI** dependencies for your platform

#### Installing pnpm

```bash
# If you don't have pnpm installed
npm install -g pnpm
```

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/djyde/ccconfig.git
cd ccconfig
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. **Start development server**

```bash
pnpm tauri dev
```

The application will open in a new window with hot-reload enabled for both frontend and backend changes.

## 🚀 Build Commands

### Development

```bash
# Check TypeScript for errors (recommended before commits)
pnpm tsc --noEmit

# Start development server with hot reload
pnpm tauri dev

# Start frontend only (useful for UI development)
pnpm dev
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Format code with Biome
pnpm exec biome check .

# Format code (Biome)
pnpm exec biome format .

# TypeScript type checking
pnpm tsc --noEmit
```

## 📋 Development Guidelines

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Follow the code style guidelines
- Add comments for complex logic
- Update documentation if needed
- Test your changes thoroughly

### 3. Quality Checks

```bash
# Check TypeScript errors
pnpm tsc --noEmit

# Format code
pnpm exec biome format .

# Run any existing tests
# (test commands will be added here when available)
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
# or
git commit -m "fix: resolve your bug description"
```

Use conventional commit messages:
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `style:` for code formatting changes
- `refactor:` for code refactoring
- `test:` for adding tests
- `chore:` for maintenance tasks

### 5. Submit a Pull Request

- Push your branch to GitHub
- Create a pull request with a clear description
- Link any relevant issues
- Wait for code review
